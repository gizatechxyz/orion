# ONNX Cairo Runtime :sparkles:

**ONNX Runtime inference** can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with different hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms.

In this repository you can find the new ONNX Runtime built using [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/). The purpose of this repository is to provide the runtime implementation for verfiable ML model inferences using STARKs.

✨🚀 **New contributors are welcome to implement new ONNX Operators in Cairo 1.0!** 🌟💡
